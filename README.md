# Project Description
This project uses python with Pygame framework to create a 2D game where the player can purchase seeds, plant them, and harvest crops to earn money.

# Project background information
This project was created by four UIC students as part of the coding project for CS 440: Software Engineering I Spring 2024 course. This project was managed by everyone using Agile methodology with Jira, with weekly sprints and regular in person meetings to discuss progress and plan next steps. **Due to organization repository not being public, this repository was created to showcase the project**.

# Game Features
- **Seed Purchasing**: Players can buy different types of seeds using in-game currency.
- **Planting**: Players can plant seeds in designated areas.
- **Watering**: Players need to water the plants regularly to ensure they grow.
- **Fertilizing**: Players can use fertilizer to speed up the growth of their crops.
- **Harvesting**: Once the crops are fully grown, players can harvest them to earn money.
- **Selling Crops**: Harvested crops can be sold in the market for profit.
